These are my dotfiles.

Feel free to take whatever you want.

I recommend you have this repo in a folder separate from your HOME directory and create sym-links to your config files. This can easily be done with `make deploy` or `make force deploy`, the latter overrides existing config files. \
**Please note that this does not work with .oh-my-zsh**, I suggest you clone it separately from [this link](https://github.com/przmktrc/oh-my-zsh).
